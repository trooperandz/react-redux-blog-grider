*React notes

  -React Router:
    Flow:
      User changes URL,
      History is recorded in history library & figures out what changed
      Router receives new route and decides new components to show based on the route
      React does its rendering of the components

  -State:
    The route can take care of a piece of application state


  -Lodash
    Use mapKeys to turn array into object with prop key as key
